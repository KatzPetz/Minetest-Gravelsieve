# Gravel Sieve Mod
A Mod for those who do not want to spend half their lives underground...

Inspired from a Minecr**t Video on YT.

This mod simplifies the extraction of ores by the fact that ores can be obtained simply by sieving gravel.

This mod includes three new tools:
 - a hammer to produce gravel from Cobblestone
 - two gravel sieves to find ores (a manual sieve and a automatic sieve)

The sieved gravel can be crafted to Compressed Gravel (inspired by Modern Hippie) and "cooked" in the furnace to get Cobblestone again.

Recipe for the Gravel Sieve:
